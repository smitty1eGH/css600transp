## WHAT IS IT?

Simulation Req's:

Environment- patches

- exit area

- Flammable patches

-- walls

-- floors

-- grass

- Burning

- burnt


Agent actions

- agents have variable speeds

- agents can die

- agents move towards exit area

- agents cant move through each other

- the number of agents is variable

- agents are randomly placed on floor patches

- is there a way to specify agent placement through the UI?



Sim UI features:

- can specify the map

- can control flamability of patches

- number of agents

- starting fire spots

- agent speed distribution
