\section {Introduction}



\section {Background}
\subsection{Previous Work}

\cite{kneidl}
\cite{kuligowskil}
\cite{abmEvac}
\cite{zhouSimulationPedestrianEvacuation2019}

This paper is key as it is extremely similar and a netlogo implementation.  we should know this paper and incorporate into our paper \cite{prioritEvac}

\section {Methodology}
this introductory section will discuss how we approached the problem
\subsection{Environment}
this section will discuss the netlogo environment, how maps are loaded, the different patch types, the different agent speeds

need to talk about patch parameters
\subsection{Movement Mechanisms}
this section will discuss agent and fire movement algorithms

The cost algorithm, where $P_s$ is a safety patch, where $A_w$ is the person path weight, a weight that a person adds to a patch due to blocking (this is configurable by the user)
\begin{align}
cost(P)  = distance(P_s, P) + Agent(P) * A_w \nonumber \\
Agent(P)=
\begin{cases}
1, & \text{Agent Present}  \\
0, & \text{Agent Not Present} 
\end{cases}
\end{align}

this can be configured through equal diagonal weight flag. if False the Distance is the Manhattan distance \footnote{ https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/mathematics/manhattan-distance}. If true the distance is the Chebyshev Distance \footnote{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chebyshev\_distance}
\begin{align}
distance(P_1, P_2)  = \nonumber\\
equal-diagonal-weight?=
\begin{cases}
	max(|x_1-x_2|, |y_1-y_2|), & True \\
	|x_1-x_2|+ |y_1-y_2|, & False
\end{cases}
\end{align}


patch to move to algorithm, where $A_p$ is the patch for a given agent, $P_x$ \& $P_y$ are the $X$ \& $Y$ coordinates for a given patch
\begin{align}
neighbors_4 (P)  = \{patch(P_x - 1, P_y -1), patch(P_x + 1, P_y -1), \nonumber \\ 
patch(P_x - 1, P_y + 1),patch(P_x + 1, P_y + 1)\}   
\end{align}

\begin{equation}
move(A) = min(cost(neighbors_4 (A_p)))
\end{equation}

Person will wait for a better patch.  This is configurable by the user. If it is on then a person will wait for a patch that is less cost than it's current
\begin{equation}
people-wait?=
\begin{cases}
min(cost(A_p), move(A)), & True\\
move(A), & False
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

add person spacing algorithm, people try to avoid each other, configurable through the $add-person-spacing?$ flag and the $person\_path\_weight$, $A_w$, parameter.  here, $A_w$, is scaled by a factor of 10 since it is not the weight of being in the same square as another but of being next to another person.

\begin{equation}
add-person-spacing?=
\begin{cases}
	cost(P) \sum Agent(neighbors_4(P)) * A_w / 10, & True \\
	cost(P), & False
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Experiments}

describe our experiment harness that we built, netlogo behavior space, sql alchemy

\subsubsection{experiments that are based on layouts.}  

- need to run an experiment on the exit\_dims\_n map files that vary the size and placement of the exits . static 500 people of the same speed for each run

- need to run experiment on using a.map that plots mean escape time as we increase number of agents.  probably 50 to 500 step size 10

\subsubsection{experiments that are based on agent mechanisms}

- vary experiments of person path weighting and agent speeds/distributions

\subsubsection{experiments that are based on patch parameters.}

-  this may be obe by the exclusion of the fire mechanism

\subsubsection{experiments that replicate emergent crowd behaviors from other papers}
- maiinly from this paper \cite{almeidaCrowdSimulationModeling2013}  .  

- herding and flocking

-arching and crowding

if we can show that we achieve similar results even though we use a simplified pathing algorithm and abm environment i think that would be insightful
