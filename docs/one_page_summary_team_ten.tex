\section {Introduction}

The inherent dangers in doing live simulations of emergency evacuations has led to an increasing reliance on computer simulations to understand emergent behaviors of crowds under strenuous conditions\cite{almeidaCrowdSimulationModeling2013}.  Our project will seek to understand crowd evacuation behaviors through the modeling of a variety of environmental and agent factors in the NetLogo simulation suite.

\section {Experiments}

\section {Environment}

\section {Deliverables}
We will deliver a formal paper describing our experiments, the simulation software we created, our results, and the conclusions we can generate from those results. In addition we will develop presentation material to communicate concisely our overall project that will include live simulations or video recordings of previous simulations.

NOTES

\


Fire Sim models emergency evacuation of a chosen floorplan, for example in the case of fire.

The environment patches include rooms, corridors, and exit areas, as well as patches in normal, burning, and burnt states.

Agents are randomply placed people moving at various speeds and directions, but which can die and block each other.

Maps are editable for layout, patch flammability, number of agents, initial fire locations, agent speed range and plancement.

Research Goals:

\begin{itemize}
\item Evaluate the affect of floor plans and exit doors on escape rates
\item Determine maximum occupancies as function of design and area
\item Evaluate the impact of fire spread on escape rates
\item Stretch Goals
\begin{itemize}
\item Evaluate agent evacuation strategies
\item Evaluate propogation of knowledge of fire
\item Simulate smoke propogation
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

HOW IT WORKS

Simulation Req's:

Environment- patches

    exit area

    Flammable patches

-- walls

-- floors

-- grass

    Burning

    burnt

Agent actions

    agents have variable speeds

    agents can die

    agents move towards exit area

    agents cant move through each other

    the number of agents is variable

    agents are randomly placed on floor patches

    is there a way to specify agent placement through the UI?

Sim UI features:

    can specify the map

    can control flamability of patches

    number of agents

    starting fire spots

    agent speed distribution
